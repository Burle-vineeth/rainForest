        <div class="para">
            Illegal deforestation is a gateway activity to clearing rainforest, one of the primary causes of climate
            change. According to the UN up to 90% of logging in tropical rainforests is illegal.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            The reason we start with a focus on stopping illegal logging is because, in case after case, we have seen
            first hand that if you can protect the trees, you end up protecting everything else.

        <div class="para">
            The RFCx monitoring system gives our partners the opportunity to protect key rainforest areas and respond to
            real-time alerts, while sharing large amounts of ecosystem data that help negotiate increased protections in
            these areas. In some cases, protecting the perimeter of a rainforest can actually mean protecting everything
            behind it.

            Our goal at Rainforest Connection is to make sure poachers no longer have free reign over the world’s
            rainforests. To that end, we use the RFCx system to help our partners recognize patterns of activity related
            to poaching, including alerts for trucks, cars and motorcycles being used by poachers in key protected
            areas.

                    In Africa we were able to demonstrate on a test basis that protecting and monitoring one key road

                </li>
                <li>
                    We were able to show patterns of activity related to vehicles and poaching in the protected area

                </li>
                <li>
                    The RFCx system helped our partners allocate limited manpower to to target key times and days each
                    month where poaching activities were statistically very high.

                    Loss of biodiversity can damage a rainforest habitat to the same degree as climate change and air

                    Illegal bushmeat hunting hampers a rainforest’s ability to disperse the types of seeds it needs to
